			<h2 class="centerText">About Me</h2>
			<p>As you know already, my name is Mark. I enjoy coding, especially web development, but 
			I definitely have a firm grasp on object-oriented programming languages like Java and C++. 
			I get to be a little more creative and artistic with web development, which I think is a nice
			equilibrium after working with so many object-oriented projects. </p>
			<p>I was always interested in computers, even at a young age. I was using my fifth grade 
			teacher’s message boards to talk to my classmates, and I was playing all sorts of computer
			games. I started getting into coding while I was in middle school. At first I was mainly 
			interested in creating websites. I was always using the computer, and I was really
			interested in the process of how sites were even created. Once I entered high school I
			took the basic HTML and CSS courses that my school offered and never looked back. I also
			took AP computer science while in high school, and I think that was the definitive push
			into pursuing a degree in code.</p>
			<p>I’d say the thing I like most about developing is that it never gets boring because there
			is always a challenge to overcome. After working so many part-time jobs, the worst part about
			a job is when you are just sitting there doing nothing. During summer semester while working
			Panda Express I was lucky to have what few customers I had. </p>
			<p>One of the things I don’t like about coding is that it can become all I think about. 
			Working on school projects and getting stuck on sections just leads to me thinking about 
			how to solve it all the time – in the shower, before falling asleep, etc. </p>
			<p>Anyways, thanks for reading. Hope you got some insight to my background and how I think.</p>
