			<p>Hello! My name is Mark Tawara. I am currently a junior at the University of Georgia, and I am studying Computer Science.</p>
			<p>My plans for this website are, at the moment, to simply write about myself, include my resume in pdf format, upload previous works, and to add ways to contact me easily. I'd like to play around more with Photoshop to make images and backgrounds for this website, but for now only the title has been constructed.</p>
			<p>This website is being developed in Eclipse, and all the source code can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/mtawara/MySite">github.</a></p>
			You can also see my linkedin <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/mtawara">here</a>.
			<p>Thanks for taking a look!</p>
